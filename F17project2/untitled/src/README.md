# F17project2
This project was to make a capturing game where any number of players take turns attempting to surround one other player. In theory and in practice, it is not very fun at all, but merely a means of testing ability to write the logic behind it.

Rules:
-You surround a player by being the ONLY player to surround the NESW directions around their piece or groups of pieces.
-If surrounding a player involves surrounding yourself, it is both legal and winning.

Unfortunately this makes it easy to have invincable tiles on the board (tiles that have 2 "eyes" or adjacent to at least 2 or more opposing players). Like I said, a terrible game in practice.
